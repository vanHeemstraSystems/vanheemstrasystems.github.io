          </a>Step 1 - Use case: calculator</h3>

        <p>As an example of software development, we assume a use case that requires the creation of a calculator.</p>

          </a>Step 2 - System architecture: calculator</h3>

        <p>As a calculator is a software system in its simplest format, we first create a diagram to represent the use case
          visually, using the C4Model (Context, Container, Component, Classes/Code).</p>
        <p>See also:
          <a href="https://c4model.com">https://c4model.com</a> and <a href="https://c4model.com and https://github.com/willem-vanheemstrasystems/c4model-headstart</a></p>
          <p>A software system (also known as system context) is made up of one or more containers (web applications, mobile apps, desktop applications, databases, file systems, etc), each of which contains one or more components, which in turn are implemented by one or more classes (or code).</p>
          <p>In our use case, the calculator is the software system, as it is assumed to be a standalone system with no dependencies on the outside.</p>
          <p>The online c4model diagrams are at <a href=" https://structurizr.com/workspace/38150#SystemContext ">https://structurizr.com/workspace/38150#SystemContext</a></p>
          <p>The high level diagrams are programming language independent.</p>

          <p><strong>Level 1: System Context diagram</strong></p>
          <p></p>A System Context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with.</p>
          
          <p></p>Detail isn't important here as this is your zoomed out view showing a big picture of the system landscape. The focus should be on people (actors, roles, personas, etc) and software systems rather than technologies, protocols and other low-level details. It's the sort of diagram that you could show to non-technical people.</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Scope</strong>: A single software system.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Primary elements</strong>: The software system in scope.</li> 
            <li><strong>Supporting elements</strong>: People and software systems directly connected to the software system in scope.</li>
          
              <li><strong>Intended audience</strong>: Everybody, both technical and non-technical people, inside and outside of the software development team.</li>
          </ul>

          </a>Step 3 - Coding: calculator</h3>
          
            <p>As we will be producing code, it is good practise to set up a code versioning control system. Here we choose Git and the GitHub service.</p>  
            <h4>GitHub</h4>
            <p>In order to connect with github, we'll make use of a tool called <strong>curl</strong>. Download the version that matches your OS from <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">http://curl.haxx.se/download.html</a></p>
            <p>For Windows, we'll be using cynwin which is also offered at the previous URL.</p>
            <p>After installing curl, run the following command:</p>
            <pre>curl https://api.github.com</pre>
            <p>This will return a JSON-formatted list of entry points to query GitHub even further.</p>
            <p>To create a repository for our use case of building a calculator, assuming that we have registered with GitHub as user '', run the following command to create the 'calculator' repository.</p>
            <pre>curl ...</pre>
        <p>Following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, we'll now code the software for the calculator software system.</p>  
<p>For the purpose of demonstration, we use different programming languages to achieve the same goal.</p>

    <p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ ">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<a id="designer-templates " class="anchor " href="#designer-templates " aria-hidden="true "><span class="octicon octicon-link "></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

  <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821 " class="user-mention
            ">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt " class="user-mention ">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett
            " class="user-mention ">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo " class="user-mention ">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
